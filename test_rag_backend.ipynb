He continued to explain how Aamjiwnaang has experienced \\ndisproportionate environmental health impacts from toxic industrial pollution in their terri -\\ntory, which is located in the heart of Canada's “Chemical Valley,” at the south end of Lake \\nHuron, on the east side of the St. Clair River across the Canada–US border in Port Huron, \\nMichigan. For over a decade, Aamjiwnaang has been classified as a “sacrifice zone”; as many \\ncommunity members explain: “that is what we feel like.” 1\\nJust 2 years prior to Chief Plain's testimony, Canada's House of Commons Standing \\nCommittee on Environment and Sustainable Development called Aamjiwnaang band \\nmember Silvia Plain to testify about her lived experiences in Chemical Valley on November \\n22, 2022. Seated next to a representative from the Mining Association of Canada, Silvia \\nspoke alongside other stakeholders to discuss Bill S-  5 An Act to amend the Canadian \\nEnvironmental Protection Act, 1999, to make related amendments to the Food and Drugs \\nAct, and to repeal the Perfluorooctane Sulfonate Virtual Elimination Act , or as more widely \\nknown, the Strengthening Environmental Protection for a Healthier Canada Act . Noting the \\nAamjiwnaang First Nation's location in the midst of Canada's Chemical Valley—the dens -\\nest concentration of petrochemical and polymer facilities in the country—she urged the \\nMembers of Parliament present to note how “Children in Aamjiwnaang are being born \\npre- polluted, and continued to be exposed throughout crucial periods of their develop -\\nment.” Despite these ongoing testimonies, continuous activism efforts, and requests for \\nenvironmental policy transformation, the everyday pollution continues. This paper thus ar -\\ngues that Aamjiwnaang community members' involvement in formal legislative and policy \\nprocesses can be understood as a paradox of public engagement: at once they are called to \\n 1Silvia Plain, testimony before the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development, Friday November 25, \\n2022.

The unfolding analysis explains why this sacrifice zone \\nscenario exists, and how it might be otherwise.\\nIn the heart of the Great Lakes, where waters flow between Canada and the United States, \\nlocated at the southernmost tip of Lake Huron on the Ontario side of the Canada-  US border, \\nan indigenous community fights for its life and the right to breathe clean air. The experiences \\nand struggles of the Aamjiwnaang First Nation, an Anishinabek community whose home is \\noccupied by Chemical Valley, Canada's densest concentration of petrochemical and polymer \\nfacilities reveals tensions over varying interpretations of the effects of toxic exposure on hu -\\nmans and the local environment. Daily, Aamjiwnaang citizens struggle to recognize their en -\\nvironmental and reproductive health concerns while living in this pollution hotspot. In 2011, a \\nWorld Health Organization study covering 91 countries and 1100 cities documented Sarnia as \\nhome to the highest amount of particulate matter per cubic meter of air in all of Canada, rank -\\ning it as Canada's top spot for air pollution in the country (“Canada's Air among the World's \\nBest: WHO | CTV News,”\\xa0 2011). While Canada's air quality ranked third highest, Sarnia \\nranked the worst in the country. Policy makers at all levels of government navigate the many \\nlayers of Canadian governance for indigenous environmental health and justice as they deter -\\nmine how best to respond to this multidimensional matter of environmental and reproductive \\njustice.2\\nJust 7 km south of Sarnia's city center, approximately 800 Anishinabek citizens live in the \\nmiddle on Chemical Valley on the Aamjiwnaang First Nation reserve. Though this place has \\nlong been their home, they articulate ongoing environmental and reproductive health concerns \\nin a struggle for environmental reproductive justice, a fledgling field of study in Canada and \\nglobally (Altamirano-  Jiménez,\\xa02020; Ecojustice,\\xa0 2007; Hoover et\\xa0al.,\\xa0 2012; McGregor,\\xa0 2009; \\nSchlosberg,\\xa02013; Scott,\\xa02008, 2009; Wiebe,\\xa02016, 2020). Responding to the lack of recognition \\nfor the community's compromised environmental health and the incessant exposure of their \\nbodies and lands to harmful pollutants, including benzene, particulate matter, toluene, sulfur \\ndioxide, and xylene, two local citizens of this community joined with Ecojustice to demand the \\nright to a clean environment. 3\\nLocally in the surrounding region of Lambton County, Aamjiwnaang community mem -\\nbers were at once invited to participate in an inclusive health study that marginalized their \\nsmall-  scale, situated concerns. In 2017, following a joint investigation from the Toronto \\nStar, Global News, National Observer, Ryerson and Concordia , the provincial Government \\nof Ontario committed to funding a health study to examine the environmental impacts of \\nChemical Valley. However, at the time of writing in 2024, the health study still does not \\nmake the link between environmental and human health, which the Aamjiwnaang Nation \\nand surrounding Lambton County have called for now for over a decade (Craig et\\xa0al.,\\xa0 2017; \\n“Toxic Secret | News, Videos & Articles,”\\xa0 n.d.). Thus, the time is ripe for critical reflection \\nand creative imagination on how to improve environmental justice and participatory public \\nhealth processes to address systemic pollution exposure and the legacy of colonialism in \\nCanada.\\n 2For a more detailed discussion of environmental reproductive justice in Canada, see Altamirano-  Jiménez, “Free Mining, Body \\nLand, and the Reproduction of Indigenous Life,” and Wiebe\\xa0( 2020).\\n 3Ecojustice represented two individuals, Ada Lockridge and Ron Plain in a Charter of Rights and Freedoms challenge under \\nsections 7 and 15, noting that the “cumulative effects” of pollution's impact on their community—in other words their geopolitical \\nlocation in the polluted heart of Canada's ‘Chemical Valley’—infringes upon their right to life, liberty, and security of the person \\nand the right to equality (Ecojustice, see https://  ecoju stice. ca/ news/ cross -  exami natio ns-  conti nue-  in-  chemi cal-  valle y-  chart er-  chall \\nenge/  .

These processes include affected communities' involvement in formal \\nproceedings such as appearing before the Senate of Canada and House of Commons commit -\\ntees federally, as well as participating in community health studies locally. This article argues \\nthat Aamjiwnaang band members continue to encounter a paradox of engagement through \\nthese administrative processes at local and federal scales: their knowledge is heard  but not \\nlistened to for meaningful action and change to address their concerns. Informed by a critical \\npolicy studies lens (Durnová,\\xa0 2022; Orsini,\\xa0 2007, 2021; Orsini & Smith,\\xa0 2010) and the guiding \\nscholarship of critical race theorists such as Sara Ahmed\\xa0( 2012), this analysis examines the \\npolitical work of such a paradox, insofar as there is a gap between procedural invitations ex -\\ntended by legislative bodies to participate in regulatory processes or public health studies and \\nthe lived experiences of community members whose concerns are heard but not listened to or \\naccommodated through substantive policy and public health outcomes.\\nThis research aims to (a) critique the practical application of environmental justice policy \\nin Canada and (b) enrich the study of environmental justice in Canada, to learn about how \\ndistributive, procedural, and discursive facets have marginalized Aamjiwnaang's lived experi -\\nences, expertise, and concerns since a countywide health study began in 2005 in their commu -\\nnity. At the same time, I propose alternative policy pathways and directions to substantively \\naddress these. The concept of facet draws from Jennifer Mason's discussion of facet methodol -\\nogy, which refers to “flashes of insight” that help to define the specific object of concern, such \\nas how the discourse of scientific expertise accentuates the edges of environmental reproduc -\\ntive justice and the “policy assemblage” of environmental injustice in Canada (Mason,\\xa0 2011; \\nWiebe,\\xa02016).\\nA critical approach is vital to understand the colonial and oppressive underpinnings of \\nCanadian institutions and their impacts on communities in practice. Following Ahmed\\xa0( 2012, \\np. 29): “Structures of governance make an institution into a body or machine,” where there is \\na system of distribution, with pathways that transfer materials to each part, “each assumed to \\nhave their own function or purpose, each participating in the overall health of the body or ma -\\nchine.” As such, this study offers a cautionary tale for the administration of environmental jus-\\ntice broadly speaking by drawing upon the experiences of Aamjiwnaang community members' \\nparticipation in federal and local policy processes specifically, as a nonindigenous academic \\nand environmental justice policy advocate seeking to engage in environmental justice policy \\nadvocacy alongside the community.\\nYet, this analysis does not end with critique. It aims to be constructive, imaginative, and \\nfuture-  oriented. Through the critical policy assessment presented here, these contributions \\naim to improve public engagement processes of this kind in the future, oriented to policy \\njustice and radical policy futures (Cattapan et\\xa0al.,\\xa0 2020, p. 244; Levac & Wiebe,\\xa0 2020, pp. \\n5–6). In doing so, I focus on each facet of environmental justice (distributive, procedural, \\n 17471346, 2024, 6, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/polp.12642 by Universitaet Lueneburg Zeitsch, Wiley Online Library on [31/03/2025].

This analysis \\nbuilds upon the policy justice framework developed by Levac and Wiebe in conversation \\nwith existing scholarship from intersectionality-  based policy analysis (“ An Intersectionality- \\nBased Policy Analysis Framework,”\\xa0 2012; Dhamoon,\\xa0 2011; Hankivsky & Jordan-  \\nZachery,\\xa0 2019) reproductive justice (Hoover et\\xa0 al.,\\xa0 2012; Saurette & Gordon,\\xa0 2013; \\n“SisterSong,”\\xa0 2013), settler-  colonial studies and decolonization (Alfred,\\xa0 2009; \\nCoulthard,\\xa0 2014; Simpson,\\xa0 2011). A critical policy studies lens informs the interpretive and \\nintersectional analysis that guides the discursive approach advanced here to assess the pub -\\nlic administration of environmental justice generally and public engagement specifically in \\nCanada's Chemical Valley. 4\\nFurther, I argue that the lens of policy justice, informed by intersectionality-  based policy \\nanalysis and interpretive policy analysis, can enhance public engagement on difficult mat -\\nters of social and environmental justice by creating space for the inclusion of indigenous \\nexpertise, stories, and knowledge into collaborative policy development and environmental \\ndecision- making (Hankivsky & Jordan- Zachery,\\xa02019; Schwartz-  Shea & Yanow,\\xa02013; Yanow \\n& Schwartz-  Shea,\\xa02014). As such, this justice-  oriented, radical policy futures approach aims \\nto move policy beyond the “illusion” of collaboration and deliberation, while highlighting \\nsystemic relations of colonialism and power in participatory, deliberative processes that per -\\npetuate the paradox of “being included,” and affected communities are “expected to adopt \\nthe terms of dialogue or debate,” but this may not provide a meaningful context for action on \\nspecific claims (Ahmed,\\xa0 2012; Cattapan et\\xa0al.,\\xa02020; Fuji Johnson,\\xa02015; Levac & Wiebe,\\xa02020; \\nMacDonald & Levasseur,\\xa0 2014; Wiebe,\\xa0 2016, p. 147). There is a wide and vast literature dis -\\ncussing the promise of the public arena for reasonable communication, interaction, and gov -\\nernance (Dryzek,\\xa0 2006; Fischer,\\xa0 2003, 2007, 2009; Fischer & Forrester,\\xa0 1993). At the same \\ntime, responding to this deliberative democracy literature, critical race and democratic theory \\nscholars evoke caution about the promise of deliberative spheres as rationally ordered realms \\noriented to consensus-  based deliberation, which may gloss over embedded and uneven power \\nrelations (Ahmed,\\xa0 2012; Fuji Johnson,\\xa02015; Mouffe,\\xa02005). This study offers a cautiously op -\\ntimistic approach to the application of deliberative democracy principles to the practical craft \\nof public engagement that follows.\\nAN INTERPRETIVE POLICY ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL \\nJUSTICE'S DISCURSIVE DIMENSIONS IN PRACTICE\\nWithin the fields of Canadian public administration, policy studies, and political science, the \\ntheory and practice of environmental justice remain understudied. Canada's legacy of colo -\\nnization, the effects of the 1876 Indian Act  and its ongoing impacts on indigenous commu -\\nnities today leave many questioning the authority and legitimacy of government and state \\nofficials. Drawing upon relevant literature in critical policy studies, environmental justice, \\nand intersectionality-  based policy analysis, an applied interpretive approach serves to analyze \\nand examine a site-  specific problem of environmental injustice in Canada, with particular \\nimplications for the indigenous citizens of Aamjiwnaang living in their homelands which are \\noccupied today by Chemical Valley. Their concerns are expressed through public testimonies \\nand in- depth interviews.\\n 4See also Dhamoon, “Considerations on Mainstreaming Intersectionality” and “An Intersectionality-  Based Policy Analysis \\nFramework”; Hankivsky and Jordan-  Zachery, The Palgrave Handbook of Intersectionality in Public Policy ; Orsini, “Discourses in \\nDistress: From ‘Health Promotion’ to ‘Population Health’ to ‘You Are Responsible for Your Own Health’”; Orsini and Smith, \\n“Social Movements, Knowledge and Public Policy: The Case of Autism Activism in Canada and the U.S.”\\n 17471346, 2024, 6, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/polp.12642 by Universitaet Lueneburg Zeitsch, Wiley Online Library on [31/03/2025].

In both federal and local administrative and policy proceedings, \\nAamjiwnaang's struggles for knowledge were bound up within discursive facets of contested \\nforms of science and expertise. Citizens entered a “complex field of contingent governance” \\nexternal and internal to their own community as they formed partnerships with governments \\nand researchers (Hobson,\\xa0 2013, p. 63). These processes are not neutral but significantly \\ncharged with political meaning. Numerous scholars demonstrate how power relations extend \\nbeyond institutional parameters and manifest through discourse as a technology of power \\n(“An Intersectionality-  Based Policy Analysis Framework,”\\xa0 2012; Fiske & Browne,\\xa0 2008; \\nHankivsky,\\xa02011; Hankivsky & Jordan- Zachery,\\xa02019; Hudon & Rouillard,\\xa02015; Orsini,\\xa02007; \\nOrsini & Smith,\\xa0 2010; Saurette & Gordon,\\xa02013). As Paul Saurette and Kelly Gordon\\xa0(2013, p. \\n157) have demonstrated, “how we talk” indeed matters to the study of politics. This critical, \\ninterpretive, and discursive approach to political science and public administration draws \\ninto focus how language contains, carries, and transmits subtle messages that shape social \\nand political meaning.\\nCentering community voices\\nIn order to create space for alternative perspectives, to amplify community voices that have \\nbeen marginalized, and to counter hegemonic narratives, an interpretive lens first critiques \\nuneven power relations. Building upon the work of poststructural scholars, as Pierre-  André \\nHudon and Christian Rouillard\\xa0( 2015, p. 533) discuss, this critical lens borrows from Michel \\nFoucault's concept of governmentality to examine the expression and practices of power be -\\nyond institutions by interrogating discourse and language as instruments of power. These \\npower relations take shape in multiple directions beyond the formal institutional realm and \\nalso manifest in the civic sphere.\\nA poststructural lens offers a word of caution to any political process. In particular, Foucault's \\nwork on governmentality “dissects the concept of the State” and also “identifies the type of \\n 5For a more detailed discussion of postmodern policy analysis, see Bacchi and Goodwin\\xa0( 2016).

The interpretive analysis and approach presented here go further than poststructuralism to \\nimagine possibilities for the creation of counternarratives that enhance opportunities for mean-\\ningful public engagement on matters of social and environmental justice. This requires both an in-\\nvestigation of hierarchical top- down state- driven policies and reconsideration of horizontal forms \\nof authority, expertise, and decision making, as well as careful engagement with those directly \\naffected by injustice in their everyday lives.\\nPolitical ethnography\\nThis analysis builds upon over 10 years of community-  engaged research as a nonindigenous \\nacademic-  activist working closely with the Aamjiwnaang Nation to advocate for environmen -\\ntal justice (Wiebe,\\xa0 2016, 2018, 2019). Involvement includes a formal period of political ethnog -\\nraphy and community immersion (2010–2012), ongoing policy activism (2012–present), \\nparticipation in one Senate of Canada hearing to offer expert witness testimony on Bill C-  226 \\nabout environmental racism and environmental justice in Canada (2024) and contributing to \\nthe implementation strategy of this Bill following its passage during an Environmental Justice \\nSymposium convened by the federal Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Canada \\n(ECCC) alongside leaders from the Aamjiwnaang Nation. 6 As such, my role as a community- \\nengaged researcher includes being both a participant observer of formal administrative pro -\\nceedings and policy responses to Aamjiwnaang's health concerns, as well as being an engaged \\nand observing participant including the presentation of testimony along with Chief Plain in \\nformal Senate of Canada deliberations and joining a policy advocacy panel with members of \\nthe Aamjiwnaang Environment Department in Ottawa.\\nPublic hearing transcripts and interview findings discussed here focus on the perspectives \\nof those who participated in both formal administrative proceedings such as Senate of Canada \\nand House of Commons deliberations as well as local public health deliberations within \\nLambton County.

From a participatory action research and political ethnography \\napproach (Schatz,\\xa02009; Wiebe,\\xa02016; Wiebe & Taylor,\\xa02014), this study involved participant obser-\\nvation during the LCHS townhall meetings in the Fall of 2010 and attending monthly board meet-\\nings as an observer (January–December 2011).

The distributive dimension \\nhighlights the uneven location of environmental harms. As David Schlosberg and environmen -\\ntal justice scholars in a Canadian setting discuss in greater detail, attention to the distributive \\ndimension of environmental justice reveals how “some communities receive more environ -\\nmental risks than others” (Agyeman et\\xa0al., 2009 ; Schlosberg,\\xa0 2013, p. 38). In broad terms, dis -\\ntributive justice generally refers to the “distribution of benefits and burdens” (Sager,\\xa0 2012, p. \\n58). This scholarship entails examining what resources are distributed and how, the principles \\nof allocation, identification of sites for struggle, and an examination of the conditions under \\nwhich citizens make their claims. This approach focuses on state-  institutional parameters for \\nredistribution among a citizenry.\\nProcedural dimensions of environmental justice center upon structural and participatory \\nprocesses that bring citizens into deliberation with institutions. Such deliberative processes are \\nforms of public engagement, which generally begin by recognizing the scope and parameters \\nof existing injustices, further seek to identify citizen concerns, needs and wants; and, sub -\\nsequently gesture toward mitigating and responding to affected communities' concerns and \\nrights (Levac & Wiebe,\\xa0 2020). A concrete example of this becomes apparent in the official \\nresponses to Aamjiwnaang's controversial birth ratio study (Mackenzie et\\xa0al.,\\xa0 2005). Findings \\nfrom this study were generated from data based upon community-  led participatory mapping \\nactivities, which documented a declining rate of male births in Aamjiwnaang.\\nWith respect to the discursive dimensions, following the flurry of media attention that \\npoured over Aamjiwnaang in the wake of the sex ratio study's release in 2005, local policy \\nmakers began to generate their own findings (Mittlestaedt,\\xa0 2004, 2005). In 2007, Lambton \\nCounty's Community Health Services Department, Health Promotion and Program Support \\nUnit produced its own reproductive health report, showing no correlation of a skewed birth \\nratio when scaled from the local population of Aamjiwnaang to the county as a whole, thus \\ndisregarding Aamjiwnaang lived experience and expertise (Lambton County,\\xa0 2014). While \\nthe report's findings did not address the acute features of Aamjiwnaang's reproductive health \\nconcerns, representatives from Aamjiwnaang began a conversation with affected parties \\n(i.e., “stakeholders”), community leaders, and policy makers within the City of Sarnia and \\nLambton County about persistent health concerns on reserve and elsewhere within the county. \\nBetween 2005 and 2007, informal meetings evolved into the formation of a health study board, \\ncomprised of First Nations, union, labor, industry, occupational health, community associa -\\ntion, and public health spokespeople. The Lambton Community Health Study (LCHS) was \\nborn with a mandate to study the health effects associated with exposure to environmental \\nemissions as a public health priority across the county.\\nIn addition to the distributive and procedural dimensions of justice, the discursive dimen -\\nsions of environmental justice highlight the transmission of power through deliberation and \\nlanguage, referred to here as discourse. The following sections emphasize the discursive poli -\\ntics of environmental reproductive justice by focusing on official responses to Aamjiwnaang's \\n 17471346, 2024, 6, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/polp.12642 by Universitaet Lueneburg Zeitsch, Wiley Online Library on [31/03/2025].

The purpose of this section is not to simply \\ncritique administrative and public health responses for their uneven power dynamics; rather, \\nthe policy justice lens advanced here, informed by interpretive and intersectional policy anal -\\nysis, contributes to the study of public engagement to offer some actionable avenues for more \\nenvironmentally just, collaborative and decolonial policy making. Schlosberg calls for envi -\\nronmental justice scholars to “expand the sphere of a discourse” toward communities and \\ntheir situated lived experiences (Schlosberg,\\xa0 2013, p. 40). At the same time, contributing to the \\nimprovement of the public engagement processes on social and environmental justice matters \\nrequires a close investigation of both structural and discursive factors shaping the public en -\\ngagement process.\\nA struggle for environmental reproductive justice: The birth ratio study\\nTensions became most apparent during the controversy following the publication of a 2005 \\nEnvironmental Health Perspectives  (EHP) birth ratio study, which was co-  authored with \\nAamjiwnaang experts including leading activist Ada Lockridge (Mackenzie et\\xa0al.,\\xa0 2005). The \\nadministrative health data regarding Aamjiwnaang's birth rates published in the EHP article \\nwere self- reported to the government. While this indicated a skewed ratio over time, the data \\ndid not account for place of residence and thus the findings were considered by public health \\nauthorities to be scientifically insignificant.\\nAt a bare minimum, as one official explained, “you have to link exposure in the particu -\\nlar geographic location” to be able to look at particular outcomes. 7 Health Canada sought \\nto conduct a follow-  up community exposure assessment but did not receive support from \\nChief and Council, so that concluded this effort. As environmental health exposure assess -\\nment would require federal public surveillance of community health data, which made \\nmany community members nervous, given the legacy of colonial efforts to take from com -\\nmunities without consent. A revised study of this nature would require collaborative, con -\\ntinuous, iterative consent from all stages of a public health study, from conception to \\ndissemination of findings.\\nGathering reliable data is an ongoing challenge in Aamjiwnaang, Lambton County and \\nacross levels of government. One county health official noted the significance of designing an \\nappropriate approach to generate reliable data. In his words, “Any epidemiological study it's \\nabout 95% argument about methodology and 5% about the results.”8 Within Lambton County, \\nthe health unit is responsible for public health. In this capacity, county staff gather health sta -\\ntistics and write reports. Staff with epidemiological expertise collect, analyze, and report on \\npublic health topics, such as health promotion, infectious disease, and chronic disease, and \\nconduct surveillance as needed. Adding a health study into this mix falls upon the already \\noverburdened shoulders and capacities of local staff.\\nAfter the 2005 birth ratio study was released, the Lambton County public health unit \\nrecruited an Environmental Health Specialist. Their first in-  depth research task required \\nan examination of the available reproductive health data across the county. The scale of \\nthis study moved beyond what was perceived to be the small area geographical analysis of \\nAamjiwnaang (Wiebe,\\xa0 2018). The Lambton County health unit monitors data by drawing \\nfrom available data sets. The administrative reproductive health data from Aamjiwnaang \\nwas questionable, as one official claimed, because it couldn't be replicated. 9 Reproductive \\n 7Daniel, personal communication with author, 2011.\\n 8Glen, personal communication with author, 2011.\\n 9Glen, personal communication with author, 2011.\\n 17471346, 2024, 6, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/polp.12642 by Universitaet Lueneburg Zeitsch, Wiley Online Library on [31/03/2025].

The federal \\ngovernment also conducted a study in response: “StatsCan did an internal analysis on the basis \\nof postal code—they haven't seen the same picture that was shown in the article.” 10 Evidently, \\nthe environmental and reproductive health data of Aamjiwnaang and Lambton County is con -\\ntested. As a result, Aamjiwnaang's data sets were deemed inconclusive.\\nTo obtain substantive government investment into a health study of this scope, LCHS board \\nmembers discussed the need to gather reliable, scientifically sound data. Because Aamjiwnaang's \\nsample size was considered too small, the local health unit would not delve further into \\nAamjiwnaang's environmental, reproductive, respiratory, or cancer- related concerns. Instead, \\npublic health efforts centered on health promotion. One health official noted that Aamjiwnaang \\ncommunity members “are welcome to anything that we put on for educational events.” 11 The \\nepidemiological model builds upon the requirement for large sample sizes to generate general -\\nizable results (Wiebe,\\xa0 2016). In doing so, this methodology—this scaling up and away—dis -\\ncredits the smaller-  scale health concerns of local communities, as Aamjiwnaang experienced.\\nThe county as a whole bears a different mandate than that of a municipality or a reserve. \\nAccording to one county official, “we just wanted to make sure that this wasn't a problem on \\na wider scale that we should be doing something about.” 12 By widening the scope and scale of \\nthe study, Aamjiwnaang's unique concerns become diluted  (Wiebe,\\xa0 2018).13 These contested \\ndata sets highlight the need for public health approaches and policy justice-  oriented tools that \\naccount for situated knowledge, lived experience, and community expertise.\\nAamjiwnaang's sample size renders the small- scale population vulnerable to being “eclipsed” \\nby larger studies with a broader scope and mandate (Wiebe,\\xa0 2016, p. 152). These tensions over \\nthe contested composition of the community sample size became apparent during an interview \\nwith one LCHS board member: “the problem I have with the First Nations is the ‘population,’ \\nthe ‘N' factor—the sample size is not big enough.” 14\\nThe Lambton Community Health Study\\nIn 2007, the LCHS Board began a multi- pronged mandate with three distinct phases. The first \\nphase completed by 2008 entailed the establishment of a community-  based governance struc-\\nture, including municipal, industry, occupational health, and First Nations representatives. \\nComprised of 13 local delegates in addition to ex-  officio observers from Lambton County's \\nHealth Department, an observer from Health Canada, and an Independent Process Observer, \\nthe structure remained relatively constant over the years (Lambton County,\\xa0 2014). In 2010, the \\nBoard began Phase II, which included a review of scientific and epidemiological literature, \\ncommunity engagement, the development of research questions, and a call for proposals.\\nThrough an online survey and phone survey, in addition to townhall meetings, the Board \\nentered a deliberative period of citizen consultation and public engagement (Lambton \\nCounty,\\xa02014).

As a result, several alternative options \\nemerged as possible avenues through which Aamjiwnaang could potentially seek acknowl -\\nedgment of its ongoing health concerns. These range in format and scope from focused \\nbio- monitoring studies in partnership with organizations such as the Assembly of First \\nNations or liaising with university researchers like Dr. Basu, whose scientific study of the \\nimpacts of chemicals and metals including polychlorinated biphenyls on 43 mother–child \\npairs honed in on the impacts of toxins on local population health (Basu et\\xa0al.,\\xa0 2013). The \\nstudy's findings not only revealed elevated rates of PCBs and metals including mercury and \\ncadmium, some perfluorinated chemicals, and the pesticides hexachlorocyclohexane and \\nDDT were also located within the bodies of mothers and children (Basu et\\xa0al.,\\xa0 2013). Blood, \\nhair, and urine samples served as biomarkers of the community's reproductive vulnerability \\nto contamination, highlighting how toxic matter affects them on all fronts through their \\natmospheres, homes, and bodies.\\nAs these research findings reveal, participatory processes like the LCHS convey mecha -\\nnisms that reproduce discourses and knowledge that structure and constrain the parameters \\nfor meaningful public engagement, transformative policy outcomes, and environmental jus -\\ntice. Processes are “embroiled” within governmentality, an advanced liberal form of gover -\\nnance, which relies on active citizens who assume the responsibility for addressing injustice \\nwith limited state intervention to structurally revise the underlying conditions that produce \\ninjustice in the first place (Hobson,\\xa0 2013, p. 64; Wiebe,\\xa0 2016, p. 146). Seemingly inclusive par -\\nticipatory processes like the LCHS can be interpreted as civic mechanisms that reproduce \\ndiscourses and knowledge, which shape and constrain the potentiality of citizen behavior as \\nthey mobilize for social change. In this context of public engagement, some citizen's claims \\nparadoxically become disengaged as they contend with dominant, hegemonic narratives, in \\nthis case, pertaining to contested facets of scientific expertise.\\nBill C- 226: An act respecting the development of a national strategy to assess, \\nprevent and address environmental racism and to advance environmental \\njustice\\nBill C-  226 was first introduced in Canada's federal House of Commons by Green Party \\nLeader Elizabeth May on February 2, 2022.

The constant pollution has caused disturbing health effects for \\nour people, and has affected cultural relationships with the land and waters by \\nimpacting our ability to engage in traditional practices that are constitutionally \\nprotected Aboriginal and treaty rights under section\\xa035 of the Constitution Act \\nof 1982. \\n(“The Standing Senate Committee on Energy, The Environment and Natural \\nResources,”\\xa02024)\\nHis opening testimony provided critical historical context for the encroachment of industrial de-\\nvelopment and consequent pollution on his Nation's territory, and how this situation violates treaty \\nagreements and relations. He further explained the role of the federal Government of Canada in \\nenabling the development of Chemical Valley, now resulting in a situation of “over- exploitation,” \\nwhere “All facets of Aamjiwnaang's environment are polluted, including air, land and water.” \\nChief Plain's remarks noted the ongoing conditions of environmental racism, which means that \\nsome marginalized communities, like Aamjiwnaang, become “excluded from dominant cultures \\nand denied full citizenship. This marginalized status leaves communities politically powerless and \\nwithout representation in the policy- making process.”\\nFurther, when the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights \\nof the environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes \\nvisited Canada, including Aamjiwnaang and Sarnia, their November 27, 2020 report noted \\nissues related to physiological and mental stress due to impending explosions or disasters, the \\nlack of regulatory protections for the health of Aamjiwnaang members, and thus their mem -\\nbers “live on the fringes of protection from toxics,” resulting in unjust encounters with harmful \\ndiscursive framings, such as that they are at fault and that it is their “lifestyle choices” to blame \\nfor their circumstances (Human Rights Council,\\xa0 2020). The report continues to note how this \\ndiscursive framing often serves to “dismiss, discredit and even blame victims of discriminatory \\ntoxic exposure who develop diseases and disabilities, instead of placing the burden on pollut -\\ning actors to demonstrate that they did not contribute to adverse health impacts.” Moving \\nforward, Chief Plan cited the final report's recommendations to highlight some avenues for \\nimprovement, which include\\nRecognize the right to a healthy environment in its legislation, eventually, through \\na constitutional amendment, and ensure that that right includes the duty to pre -\\nvent exposure to hazardous substances;\\nBring federal, provincial and territorial legislation fully into line with the United \\nNations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples;\\nEnsure that environmental standards on reserves are as strong as or stronger than \\nthe standards on neighbouring provincial, territorial and federal lands, to ensure \\nequal protection for indigenous persons;\\n 17471346, 2024, 6, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/polp.12642 by Universitaet Lueneburg Zeitsch, Wiley Online Library on [31/03/2025].

In Lambton \\nCounty, an LCHS Board member explained how governments bear the responsibility to create \\nhealthier political environments: “the best thing you can do is get the government to tighten up \\ntheir regulations to make it more stringent.” 18 The Federal Government of Canada, under the \\nministerial authority of Health Canada, maintained a fiduciary responsibility for First Nations \\nhealth in Canada, now governed by Indigenous Services Canada as of 2017. On numerous oc -\\ncasions, representatives from this ministry approached Aamjiwnaang to offer guidance and \\nassist them to better understand the relationship between their health and the environment. \\nThese efforts were not well received as the community rejected the manner in which these pub -\\nlic health officials did so in what was perceived to be a hierarchical, elite, top-  down approach, \\nwithout creating spaces for meaningful engagement or dialogue, which would look more like \\nongoing, collaborative consent. A collaborative approach would offer Aamjiwnaang health \\nrepresentatives an opportunity to provide input on the scope and design of the study, and to \\nlead its direction, not simply participate in it as objects of inquiry.\\nDeep- rooted tensions between local, grounded expertise and that of external fly-  in “sci-\\nentific experts” persist.

As Chief Plain explained to the Senate of Canada in March 2024: “we need \\nto mend the treaty relationship between Aamjiwnaang and the Crown, where Aamjiwnaang \\nhas an equal voice in decision making affecting our lands and waters, and decisions that di -\\nrectly affect our members.” His remarks are a call to action for administrators, policy design -\\ners, and researchers to respect community leadership, expertise, and wisdom.

We would like to see the fines \\ncollected by the polluters in ‘Chemical Valley’ reinvested back to Aamjiwnaang. \\nFurthermore, we would like to contribute our regional, gendered, and intergener -\\national knowledge to support all levels of government in ensuring that we are \\nmeeting the highest standards of air quality, water quality and human rights. 19\\nHer remarks signal the need for a substantive and policy- oriented discussion of environmental \\njustice in Canada, with actionable, radical, transformative regulatory changes.\\nInviting those directly affected by toxic exposure in Lambton County to contribute to a \\nparticipatory health study is a starting point on the path to decolonial policy justice. However, \\nthe connected systemic issues of responsibility and securing adequate funds continue to be an \\nissue. Questions pertaining to the jurisdictional responsibility for providing actual dollars for \\nan environmental health study that accounts for the unique environmental reproductive health \\nconcerns experienced in Aamjiwnaang continue to be in limbo. Going forward in pursuit of \\nalternative, decolonial, “radical policy futures” requires reframing to account for indigenous \\nself- determination in health studies (Cattapan et\\xa0al.,\\xa0 2020, pp. 244–255). Standardized models \\nof investigation and environmental health studies must include a transformative approach that \\nlooks beyond simply large- scale sample sizes and studies to take affected communities stories, \\nnarratives, and lived experiences seriously as evidence.\\nIn practical terms, this means creating a shared antioppressive, situated, justice-  oriented \\nnarrative about environmental reproductive justice that honors and respects affected commu -\\nnities situated knowledge and lived experience, across all levels of government. This is critical \\nto the success of Bill C-  226 as it moves into its implementation stage while seeking to improve \\nthe environmental health, justice, and well-  being of communities like Aamjiwnaang and else -\\nwhere. Reframing radical policy futures for environmentally just ends in applied policy terms \\nentails the following components: (a) a disruption of power hierarchies; (b) public engagement \\nincluding nonconventional methods, such as storytelling; (c) the inclusion of hard-  to- reach \\npublics; and (d) established relationships of trust to build collaboration and solidarity. This \\npolicy justice-  oriented approach to radical policy futures also requires upholding community \\nknowledge and expertise in high regard, seeing this knowledge as just as credible as large-  scale \\nepidemiological medical knowledge.\\nA practical, grounded policy justice approach to environmental justice builds upon the \\ngroundwork laid by Aamjiwnaang community advocates like Silvia Plain and Ada Lockridge, \\n 19Silvia Plain, testimony before the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development, Friday, November 25, \\n2022.

Specifically, \\nan intersectional approach emphasizes that “struggles for justice do not arise in isolation but \\nare instead deeply interrelated to one another because they are constituted and sustained in \\nrelational and interactive ways through a matrix of power” (Hankivsky & Dhamoon,\\xa0 2013, \\np. 901). These matrices of power impact citizen's daily lives as they encounter systems of in -\\nequality, which require multi-  layered analytical tools to assess. To be clear: directly affected \\ncommunities' voices, knowledge, and forms of expertise must inform environmental policy \\ndevelopment in Canada.\\nAs Silvia Plain elaborated in her November 25 remarks, “it's like we're out of sight, out of \\nmind.”20 Instead of discrediting the community's data, she urged those listening to acknowl -\\nedge how they “have intergenerational data. We know what's going on. We can provide that \\ndata” based on land-  based activities and oral traditions. 21 Taking a cue from the voices of \\ncommunity advocates, this article examined how discursive encounters with public institu -\\ntions, healthcare systems and environmental policy processes are contested political spaces \\ncharged with uneven power dynamics. Designers of environmental policy making and public \\nengagement processes must thus develop new strategies to incorporate affected community's \\nsituated knowledges.\\nA decolonial approach to environmental justice and policy must recognize and respect in -\\ndigenous self-  determination, leadership, and expertise. As design scholarship informs us, this \\nrequires collaborative policy making, sharing power in decision making, and co-  designing \\nboth participatory processes of community engagement and defining outcomes (Costanza- \\nChock,\\xa02020). In response to the existing colonial policy paradigm, to enhance environmental \\njustice, those most directly affected by public policies in their daily lives must have opportu -\\nnities to provide meaningful input in all stages of environmental health policy from design \\nto dissemination of findings. Bill C-  226 is a starting point for this, with the development of a \\nnational framework. This is necessary in order to transform the distributive, discursive, and \\nprocedural dimensions of environmental justice in pursuit of decolonial policy making and \\npublic engagement now and for the generations to follow.\\nInnovative policy development requires consideration of diverse forms of expertise and \\nlocal knowledge. An orientation to radical policy futures calls for a more relationship-  focused, \\njustice lens that respects community knowledges and accounts for local, experiential, situated \\nlived experiences. Not just hearing concerns and carrying on but listening to the stories of \\nparties affected by unjust policies, to learn and improve policy design is required. Refining the \\ndiscursive dimensions of environmental justice in Canada involves collaboratively defining \\nproblems as matters of environmental justice while attending to procedural aspects of public \\nengagement and policy recommendations.\\nCONCLUDING REMARKS ON POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS FOR \\nRADICAL POLICY FUTURES\\nDeliberative and participatory policy processes illuminate the contested representation of \\ndiverse forms of knowledge.

As Dr. Ingrid Waldron \\ninforms us, we must address environmental racism for environmental justice to flourish \\n(Waldron,\\xa02018). Moving forward to implement environmental justice policy in Canada and \\nelsewhere requires acknowledging colonial harms that persist and endure through everyday \\nexposure to harmful pollutants. Pollution exposure both exposes the enduring legacy of co -\\nlonialism and environmental injustice in Canada (Liboiron, 2021 ; Wiebe,\\xa02016). But the story \\ndoes not end with these harms.\\nCommunity leaders enact and articulate strategies and solutions. Researchers, policy de -\\nsigners, and public officials must listen to and learn from their efforts. Moving forward in \\na good way for environmentally just policy outcomes means honoring indigenous stories as \\nmeaningful conduits of knowledge. Collaboratively co-  designed environmental policy must \\nsupport possibilities for self-  determination, as articulated in the United Nations Declaration \\non the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). This radical act of co-  creation can transform \\nhierarchical governance structures for more collaborative policy development. It requires a \\ncommitment to relationship-  building and negotiating policy processes that apply the principle \\nof “collaborative consent” (Phare et\\xa0al., 2016 ). Pathways for such innovative and imaginative \\ndecolonial policy making require a willingness from authoritative governing bodies to restruc -\\nture procedural responses to injustice while amplifying indigenous communities' voices, lead -\\nership, and governance.\\nThe decolonization and democratization of knowledge is critical for policy justice and rad -\\nical policy futures. Such a policy approach aligns with what Iris Marion Young refers to as \\n“communicative democracy,” which emphasizes the affective, emotional realities of political \\nlife and expression (Young,\\xa02002). Policy justice further chimes with this collaborative and di -\\nalogical emphasis, to conceptualize community members and leaders of communities affected \\nby environmental injustice as experts. This “sensing policy” approach appeals to the senses to \\ntake embodied and sensory knowledge seriously in policy creation (Wiebe,\\xa0 2019). For trans -\\nformative policy development to take shape, participatory community health studies across \\nlevels of government must creatively engage with affected communities on their own terms as \\nco- designers at every step of the process.\\nThe transformation of environmental justice policies in Canada necessitates radical refram -\\ning and attention to its multifaceted discursive dimensions. This discursive shift draws atten -\\ntion to the following critical components: accounting for community expertise, co-  designing \\nstudies, and strategies that transcend diverse bureaucracies to move beyond silos (i.e., health, \\nenvironment, justice departments) and ensuring collaborative governance and leadership. \\nSuch a shift in governance must complement new ways of working together for environmen -\\ntal and epistemic justice. This is vital for the success of environmental justice in theory and \\npractice. It means incorporating elements of scientific and indigenous knowledge by inviting \\nin a range of voices, lived experiences, and forms of expertise to the policy process from study \\ndesign through to the dissemination of findings.\\nA sensory, affective, and storied approach to public engagement signals to policy makers \\nacross levels of government the need to emphasize local expertise and the specificity of knowl -\\nedge while attending to sites of difference. Cultivating avenues for collaborative governance \\nmust include the co-  creation of policy with affected communities. When decision makers and \\ngoverning bodies create pathways to incorporate the leadership that situated experts bring \\nto this contested environmental justice policy conversation, it enriches actionable avenues \\nfor community well-  being. Doing so is urgently vital for our collective planetary health and \\nflourishing.\\n 17471346, 2024, 6, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/polp.12642 by Universitaet Lueneburg Zeitsch, Wiley Online Library on [31/03/2025].
